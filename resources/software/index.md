# Software

Dragonfly has a very different approach when its paradigms - both internal and externally-exposed APIs.

It's important to understand the differences between Dragonfly's approach to tackling common software practices when it comes to creating a server. Mainly, most differences boil down to the event-driven component of programming a software.

Later in the section, we will also go into some of the software pitfalls that can occur when you approach using Dragonfly in a more Pocketmine-MP/Nukkit approach (similar to how)

Although you may be keen to be critical of how things are done in Dragonfly, understasnd that the approach is meant to both follow Go standards as well as making your code the most extensible and performant as possible. We will cover criticisms to Dragonfly's approach and why things are done the way we are in this section as well.
