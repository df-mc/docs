If you are a developer from softwares like Pocketmine-MP and Nukkit, you are primarily used to programming in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language (e.g PHP, Java, Kotlin).

One of the biggest problems that you must overcome is to drop the concept of OOP in exchange for Go's more functional style.

Although you are probably akinned to the extremely organized and strict nature of OOP organization, these concepts simply do not work with the good practices of Go and will often backfire at you. This in turn makes your once elegant Go code, into something not so much.

In the next section, we will give a few examples of examples of paradigms you are used to in Java/PHP, make their bad equivalents in Go, explain why they are bad, and then show the best way to actually implement them in Go!
