Welcome to the Dragonfly wiki.

This wiki is the main source of information for developers looking to start developing servers and libraries 
using Dragonfly. The Dragonfly Docs is open to contributions. Pull Requests and issues may be opened at
our [docs repository](https://github.com/df-mc/docs).

## What is Dragonfly?
Dragonfly is a server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Android, iOS, Windows 10 and more). Written in Go, it allows simplistic code, super-fast startup and great performance and scaling.

Dragonfly can and is being used on production, but it's certainly not the most battle-tested. Please feel free to open issues for any bugs or features that you'd like to see addressed.

## Questions or need help?
Feel free to join our Discord server to talk.
